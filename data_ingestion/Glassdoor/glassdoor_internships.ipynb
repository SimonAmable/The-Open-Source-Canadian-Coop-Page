We empower small business owners to manage their finances fearlessly, by offering the simplest, all-in-one financial management solution they can\\'t live without.\\n\\nAbout the Engineering team:\\nWe aim to meaningfully improve the lives of small business owners, who are traditionally under-served and often struggle because of this. At Wave, you won’t just write code—you’ll build high-quality systems at scale. This means being involved in the research, design, and organizational and maintenance practices behind our wide range of applications, which are relied upon by tens of thousands of small business owners. You won’t find many hardcore specialists here. Most Wave engineers are willing and able to dive into different technologies to get the job done. This requires curiosity, openness to new ideas and perspectives, and a genuine interest in what makes software products tick.\\n\\nAbout the role:\\nAs a Software Engineer, you will join one of the many cross-functional engineering teams to work alongside Product, Design and other developers to bring your engineering skill to bear on exciting business challenges. You will work with some fantastic engineers to solve tough problems in delivering world-class financial products to our customers at scale. You will work with a wide variety of technologies and help investigate new ones as we are constantly striving to keep our technology choices up to date. As an engineering team, we deeply care about being the best in our craft - Performance, Reliability, Reusability, Code Quality, Test Coverage, and Observability. You will help maintain the current bar we have but will hopefully go on to raise it to the next level.\\n\\nHere’s What You Should Know About Engineering at Wave:\\nOur Technology: Wave is powered by several key technologies. Our toolkit is primarily Python and Django on the service layer, with some Ruby and Golang as well. GraphQL and REST power our APIs, and our web/mobile front-ends are React and ReactNative with Typescript. We expect software developers to have proficiency in one or more of these areas. You will be expected to be able to cross technical domains and contribute to both the back-end and front-end as needs arise.\\nYour Work Will Matter: Every engineer at Wave is tasked with solving meaty, meaningful challenges for a really important end-user - our small business owners. The code you write will make a difference, guaranteed.\\nWe Are a Community: Wave is about the size of a small neighbourhood. It is possible to get to know everyone on a personal basis. If you’re trying to solve a hard problem that has roots in some other part of the company, odds are pretty good that you’ll find someone close by who can help you out.\\nYou Will be Stretched: We’re big on transparency and we know Wave isn’t for everyone. However, if you’re ready to flex your creativity, excel at your craft, fuel your curiosity, and thrive in a dynamic environment, we’re confident you’ll love being a Waver.\\n\\nHere\\'s how you will make an impact:\\nWriting clear, concise, elegant, and well-tested code in Python, Ruby, and/or JavaScript.\\nWorking as part of a small, agile, integrated product team that’s focused on continual improvement of their skills and helping each other learn new things.\\nLearning new technical skills with tools or frameworks needed to execute on tasks.\\nYou Thrive Here By Possessing the Following:\\n4+ years of professional experience with some combination of Python, React, JavaScript and/or other computer language.\\nInterest in working on technical projects from inception to delivery.\\nAble to operate and monitor highly available systems in production, or willing to quickly learn how to do so.\\nPride in writing testable, modular, maintainable, simple, and well-documented code.\\nExperience with web application and/or distributed systems development.\\nFeeling right at home in the terminal.\\nStrong written and oral communication skills.\\n\\nAt Wave, you’re treated like the incredible human being you are.\\n\\nWork From Where You Work Best: We will always have a welcoming, energizing, and world-class office (in Toronto) with a space for you.

You will also be supported on this journey with diverse learning experiences, educational allowances, mentorship, and so much more.\\nWe Support the Full You: We make a serious investment in your health & wellness. When we think about benefits we think about body, mind, & soul and we take this stuff very seriously.\\nWe Take Care of the Fundamentals: Fair compensation, all the office perks you’d want, and the various goodies you’d expect from a growing tech company.
